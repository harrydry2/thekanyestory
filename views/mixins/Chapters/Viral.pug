    p I wake up late up the next morning and cook some eggs whilst I think. I want to start building the dating site, but let’s be realistic. The chances are no-one will use it and I’ll end up spending 3 months locked in my bedroom, deprived of sunlight, going insane.
    p So, instead, I open up Instagram, change my username from @harrydry to @yeezydating, delete my old posts and upload a picture with the caption “Yeezy.Dating — Coming this March”. Bamn. We’re cooking.

    p Then I make a simple “Coming Soon” landing page with an email box. I add the line “Taylor Swift fans are banned from this website 🐍”. It’s a platonic gesture but it gives the media a headline to have some fun with.
    p Next I post on the Kanye West subreddit. The post gets 300 upvotes within the first hour. This gives me ammo to fire at bloggers with. I’m no longer just “some guy” trying to shill his dating app. Reddit is my proof that this is a movement. I’ve got the backing of the people.

    p Time to build my own journalist list. I don’t really know what I’m doing so I start googling. 10 minutes later I come across this website called Buzzstream Discovery.
    p Turns out I’ve hit the jackpot. Buzzstream is amazing. You enter a search term and it spits back the names of all the journalists who have written stories about that search term. So I enter “Kanye West”, filter “within the last 30 days” and Buzzstream gives me a list of all 440 bloggers who have written stories about Kanye West over the last month. These bloggers are my perfect audience. It’s their job to pump out, simple, funny, digestible stories about Kanye West and I’m about to spoon feed them a classic.

    p Getting the names is only half the battle though. I’ve also got to get email addresses. I find this website called
      a.link(href="https://hunter.io/" target="_blank" className="link")
        | &nbsp;Hunter.io
      |  where you type the name of any company and it tells you the correct email format which that company uses.

    p Four hours later and I can take it no more. 190 “real person” emails. 147 “generic” emails are locked away in an excel doc.
    +image("excel", "Excel", "normalWidth", "png", "specImg80")
    p I type up the following message:
    .inwardSpeech Hey, I just made a dating site for Kanye fans called
      a.link(href="https://yeezy.dating" target="_blank" className="link") &nbsp;Yeezy.Dating
      | . Going crazy on
      a.link(href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Kanye/comments/82ycld/yeezydating_dating_site_for_kanye_west_fans/" target="_blank" className="link") &nbsp;Reddit&nbsp;
      | atm. Any questions please let me know :)
    p And bulk send to the 147 generic emails I've collected using Email Octopus. With my “real person” emails I take a little more care, personalising each one to fit the blogger.
    p The next 10 hours are pretty boring. I wack on my headphones, play through Kanye’s whole discography, whilst I send email after email after email after email after email. Go to sleep. Wake up and send email after email after email, then I’m back commuting into London for a day's work.
    p My phone rings during a meeting. I turn it to silent. It rings again. I turn it off. As soon as I get out of the meeting I check the database. 9,100 email address’. My mind freezes. Surely this can't be real. I click refresh. Now 9,109. What! I type Kanye West’s name into google and Yeezy Dating is everywhere. There are 150 people on my the site. 65 unread emails. Lunch break is over and I’m being called back in for another meeting. Fuck.

    p It’s 10pm when I arrive back from work. The press momentum is still rolling on. It feels good to know that my big plan worked. 25 news anchors coast to coast are discussing my imaginery dating site and I’m just in my bedroom, in my pyjamas with an old Macbook pro making the whole thing up as I go along. Let's keep riding the wave, so I start a big Yeezy Dating group chat, and invite everyone from my email list.

    p It’s 7:40 am the next day and I get a text from my pal saying, “Tune into BBC Radio 1. They’re talking about Yeezy Dating right now and they want to speak to you”. Guess where I am? On a two hour train from Portsmouth to London for another day of meetings. I try and dial into Radio 1 but there’s no signal. I’m cooped up on this train carriage and I’m stressing out. The database has over 13,000 emails now. I’ve told the media the dating site is “Coming This March”, its now 17th March and I haven’t written a line of code. And to top it all off, I’ve got no idea how to make a dating site.

    p I get back that evening, call my boss and tell him that I’m going to be out of action for a few months. He asks why. So I tell him I'll be making a dating site for Kanye West fans and he bursts out laughing. He wishes me luck and that’s that. I'm a free man.
