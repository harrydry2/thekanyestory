    p Going viral is my validation. If I can't take this viral, there's not enough hype to justify building it.
    p I start building my journalist list. I don’t really know what I’m doing so I just start googling for “Culture Blogs” and jotting down names: NME, Slate Magazine, Hypebeast, MTV
    p I wake up early and drive to the Chichester library. Today is the day I get shit done. It feels like the day before my wedding day. I want Io set everything up to go viral and so I can press play tomorrow.
    p Each blog I visit I’m looking for two emails address’. Firstly there’s the standard press enquiry It’s usually something like
      span.italic &nbsptips@hypebeast.com
      | . Secondly I’m looking for “real people” . Real writers who I can email. I search for the culture / entertainment / music editor for the each blog and write down their name. Surprisingly 90% of blogs don’t give out their own writers email, so there’s still some digging to do. I track down each writers social media and look there and if that fails I’ll go to this website called
      a.link(href="https://hunter.io/" target="_blank" className="link")
        | &nbspHunter.io
      | . You type the name of any company and it will tell you the correct email format which that company uses. For example if you search complex.com it will tell you that the email format is
      span.italic &nbsp(first).(last)@complex.com
      | .

    p I do this for a couple of hours but progress is slow. I’ve only managed about 20 names. There’s got to be a faster way. So I start googling again and 10 minutes later I find what I want: “Media and Influencer Targeting Software”. I compare the different products but the prices are ridicoulous: $299 / mo. I find this one called Buzzstream Discovery which comes with a free month trial. All I needs the free month so I sign up and cancel.
    p How Buzzstream works is you enter a search term and it spits out names of all the journalists who have wrote stories about the search term. So I enter Kanye West and filter “within the last 30 days” and Buzzstream gives me a list of all 440 influencers who have written stories about Kanye West over the last month. These influencers are my perfect audience. It’s their job to pump out, simple, digestable stories about Kanye West and I’m about to spoon feed them a classic. I make it through the top 200 names on Buzzstream and shove the names in my excel document. For every “real” email I’ll also jot down the generic “press enquiry” email.
    +image("discovery", "Buzzstream Discovery", "fullWidth")
    p At close of play I’m in good shape. 147 “generic” emails and 190 “real person” emails.
    p I change my username on Instagram from @harrydry to @yeezydating and delete all my old posts. I upload a solitary picture with the caption “Yeezy.Dating — Coming this March”.
    +image("excelgram", "Excel Instagram", "fullWidth")
    p I make a simple “Coming Soon” landing page with an email box and put it on the internet. It doesn’t look great but it does the job. I add the line “Taylor Swift fans are banned from this website 🐍. It’s a platonic gesture but it gives the media another clickbait headline to have some fun with. I’m trying to make their headline as easy as possible to write. It's another hook on my fishing line.
    p I post on the Kanye West subreddit and the post gets 200 upvotes within the first hour. This gives me ammo to fire at the press with. I’m not longer just some guy emailing trying to shill his dating app. Reddit is my social proof that this is a movement. I’ve got the backing of the people.
    +image("test6", "Landing Page", "fullWidth")
    p I write the following email: “Hey, There’s a new dating site for Kanye West fans which is trending majorly on reddit at the minute. Thought you might want to check it out ...” And bulk send to the 187 blackhole emails I've collected using Email Octopus. With my “real person” emails I take more care. I write two different templates. One for “clickbait” blogs and one for “thoughtful” blogs and start sending manually, customising to fit to the blogs feel.
    p The next 10 hours are just brute force. I wack on my headphones, play through Kanye’s whole discography and sip coffee, whilst I send email after email after email after email after email. Go to sleep. Wake up and send email after email after email, then I’m back commuting into London for a days work.

    p My phone rings during a meeting. I turn it to silent. It rings again. I turn it off. As soon as I get out of the meeting I check the database. 2100 email address’. My heart’s beating fast. I refresh the database. Now 2105 emails. I type Kanye West’s name into google. And it’s everywhere. I recognise most journalists names from my email list. I check analytics. There’s 150 people on my the site. I check my inbox. 45 unread. Lunch break is over and I’m being called back in for another meeting. Fuck being employed.
    p It’s 10pm when I arrive back from work. The press momentum is still rolling on. It feels good to know that my big plan worked. 25 news anchors coast to coast are discussing the implications of Yeezy.Dating and I’m just in my bedroom, in my pyjamas with an old Mac Book pro making the whole thing up as I go along.

    p It’s 7:40am the next day and I get a text from my pal saying, “Tune into BBC Radio 1. They’re talking about Yeezy Dating right now and they want to speak to you”. Guess where I am? On a two hour train from Chichester to London for another day of meetings. I try and dial into Radio 1 but there’s no signal on the train. I’m cooped up on this train and I’m stressing out. The database has over 10,000 emails now. I’ve told the media the dating site is “Coming This March”, its now 17th March and I haven’t wrote a line of code. And to top it all off, I’ve got no idea how to make a dating site. I can’t go on like this. I get back that evening, call my boss tell him that I’m going to be out of action for a month. He wishes me luck and that’s that. I'm a free man.
