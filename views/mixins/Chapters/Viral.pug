    p What’s the smallest, cheapest thing I can do right at this very second to see if the people want a Kanye West Dating site?
    p I open Instagram, change my username from @harrydry to @yeezydating, delete my old posts and upload a picture with the caption “Yeezy.Dating — Coming this March”. Bamn. We’re cooking.
    +image("ram", "Yeezy Dating Instagram", "normalWidth", "png", "specImg70")
    p Next I make a “Coming Soon” landing page with an email box. It looks pretty shit but I don’t care. I add the line “Taylor Swift fans are banned from this website 🐍”. It’s a Platonic gesture but it gives the media another clickbait headline to have some fun with.
    p Then I post on the Kanye West subreddit. The post gets 200 upvotes within the first hour. This gives me ammo to fire at bloggers with. I’m no longer just “some guy” trying to shill his dating app. Reddit is my proof that this is a movement. I’ve got the backing of the people.

    p Time to build my own journalist list. I don’t really know what I’m doing so I start googling. 10 minutes later I come across this website called Buzzstream Discovery.
    p Turns out I’ve hit the jackpot. Buzzstream is amazing. You enter a search term and it spits back the names of all the journalists who have wrote stories about that search term. So I enter “Kanye West”, filter “within the last 30 days” and Buzzstream gives me a list of all 440 bloggers who have written stories about Kanye West over the last month. These bloggers are my perfect audience. It’s their job to pump out, simple, funny, digestible stories about Kanye West and I’m about to spoon feed them a classic.

    p Getting the names is only half the battle though. I’ve also got to get email addresses. Sometimes the blogger leaves it on their social media and if that fails there’s this website called
      a.link(href="https://hunter.io/" target="_blank" className="link")
        | &nbsp;Hunter.io
      |  where you type the name of any company and it tells you the correct email format which that company uses.
    +image("hunter", "Hunter", "normalWidth hunterIMG")
    p For every real email I get I also jot down the generic “press enquiry” email for that company. Four hours later and I can take it no more. 190 “real person” emails. 147 “generic” emails are locked away in an excel doc.
    +image("excel", "Excel", "normalWidth", "png", "specImg80")
    p I type up the following message:
    .inwardSpeech Hey, I just made a dating site for Kanye fans called
      a.link(href="https://yeezy.dating" target="_blank" className="link") &nbsp;Yeezy.Dating
      | . Going crazy on
      a.link(href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Kanye/comments/82ycld/yeezydating_dating_site_for_kanye_west_fans/" target="_blank" className="link") &nbsp;Reddit&nbsp;
      | atm. Any questions please let me know :)
    p And bulk send to the 147 generic emails I've collected using Email Octopus. With my “real person” emails I take a little more care, personalising each one to fit the blogger.
    p The next 10 hours are pretty boring. I wack on my headphones, play through Kanye’s whole discography, whilst I send email after email after email after email after email. Go to sleep. Wake up and send email after email after email, then I’m back commuting into London for a days work.
    p My phone rings during a meeting. I turn it to silent. It rings again. I turn it off. As soon as I get out of the meeting I check the database. 9100 email address’. I refresh the database. Now 9109. I type Kanye West’s name into google. Yeezy Dating is everywhere. I recognise most journalists names from my email list. I check analytics. There’s 150 people on my the site. I check my inbox. 65 unread. Fuck. Lunch break is over and I’m being called back in for another meeting. Fuck being employed.

    p It’s 10pm when I arrive back from work. The press momentum is still rolling on. It feels good to know that my big plan worked. 25 news anchors coast to coast are discussing my imaginery dating site and I’m just in my bedroom, in my pyjamas with an old Macbook pro making the whole thing up as I go along. I’ve got to hold onto momentum somehow, so I start a big group chat, and invite everyone from my email list.
    +video("abcVideo", "poster2.png")
    p It’s 7:40 am the next day and I get a text from my pal saying, “Tune into BBC Radio 1. They’re talking about Yeezy Dating right now and they want to speak to you”. Guess where I am? On a two hour train from Portsmouth to London for another day of meetings. I try and dial into Radio 1 but there’s no signal on the train. I’m cooped up on this train and I’m stressing out. The database has over 10,000 emails now. I’ve told the media the dating site is “Coming This March”, its now 17th March and I haven’t wrote a line of code. And to top it all off, I’ve got no idea how to make a dating site. I can’t go on like this. I get back that evening, call my boss tell him that I’m going to be out of action for a month. He wishes me luck and that’s that. I'm a free man.
