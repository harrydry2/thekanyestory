    p And then I wake up one fine spring morning and it’s all done. I’m a couple of weeks late, but that’s ok. I fix the final bug from the lab at 3pm and post on Instagram to build some hype.
    p Then I cycle to town and walk into Vodafone. I tell the store manager I’m “just browsing” whilst I test the site on all their different devices. iPhone’s are zooming in on my input fields and it’s breaking my CSS. Fuck. I pitch up in Starbucks next door, grab a croissant, and start googling. Turns out my font size needs to be 16px on iOS to the stop auto zoom. I head back into Vodafone, “more browsing” I tell the store manager, and the problems solved. Happy Days.
    p The group chat still has a buzz about it. Several hundred messages a day. They’re like my army of ultra fans. My plan is to launch with them first to test the site works. I’m back at home, dotting I’s crossing T’s. Suddenly I have 10 mentions in Telegram. The ultras have found the site and have started making profiles.

    p 10 profiles are up. Now 20. Now 30. Shit. It’s happening. Beautiful profile photos appearing up on my screen. Real people are on the site. Real people are matching each other. Real people are messaging. It’s working. And I made all of this! Hahah. Look at me go.I post on Instagram saying that Yeezy.Dating is open for business. Suddenly 200 people flood to the site.
    p Legend says that the fisherman on shore only sees a tsunami a couple of seconds before it hits. Capow! Left, right, center, profile images are disappearing. 5 pictures vanishing every second. I refresh the page, images disappearing everywhere. Time slows down. Panic takes over. I can’t think straight. 3 minutes later the site is stripped bare. 250 profiles. No images. I load up Heroku. 6,700 critical errors. My Dad potters in from the kitchen to see how the big launch is going. Not great I tell him.

    p I woke up Steve Jobs. I'm ending the day Steve Harvey. The sites properly crashed now. I’m trying to put out fires everywhere but nothing’s working. I can’t do this anymore. I apologise to my followers on Instagram, I apologise to the ultras on Telegram, and I fall into bed.

    p Next day I wake up and do nothing. Eat some cereal. Watch some Peep Show. I’m still at a low ebb. I manage to write a post on the Indie Hackers forum explaining the site crashing and what went wrong with the images.

    p Quite remarkably developers start giving me their email address, offering me help. I’m blown away by their generosity. Within 24 hours there’s five pro devs digging through my code. Several changes later they give it the all clear. “Good luck”, one texts me from Singapore.

    p A few days later Yeezy.Dating launches again. The feeling is different this time. The first time it felt like the biggest thing in the universe. This time around I’ve got perspective. There a bigger things in life. If it crashes. It crashes.
    p Testing with the ultras goes well so I start emailing my big list.
    +image("launchemail", "Emails", "normalWidth")
    p Testing with the ultras goes well so I start emailing my big list. 1500 users join within 10 hours. 2500 within 24 hours. 4100 users now but growth is slowing. My intuition is telling me that the parties going to end soon. Where’s the next 4000 coming from?
    p There’s no marketing budget, no development team, it’s just me. Replying to all the emails, fixing all the bugs, trying to keep momentum up and I’m burnt out. We need an app. I’m not an app developer. We need ten thousand users for dating to work. I haven’t got the resources to get ten thousand users. Existing users are losing interest faster than new ones are joining. I’m thinking 5 moves ahead and I can see cheque mate in the distance. Suddenly it hits me. There’s only one way out. I've got to get Kanye West involved.
