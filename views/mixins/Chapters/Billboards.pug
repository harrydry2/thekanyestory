    p So I’m back in the lab. Emailing away. Managers, ex managers, stylists, pr relations, anyone who has ever worked for YEEZY on Linkedin. But nothing. No replies. I can’t get through.
    p I ask my Dad for advice. “You’ve got to think on a bigger scale son”, he tells me. So now I’m thinking what if I make a video, or a mixtape, or a magazine or a painting, or I rent a plane and fly a banner. Then it hits me. I’m going to rent Billboards. YEEZY is opening offices in Calabasas, New York, London, Wyoming. Four locations. Four billboards. Nothing fancy. No frills. No spills. Just brute force. Simple. Controversial. Crazy.
    p Ten minutes later I’m on the phone with Billboard companies. Trying to understand the landscape. Quizzing them. What’s your pricing like? What type of Billboard would you recommend? How quickly can we do this? What’s the shortest time each Billboard can stay up for?
    +image("table", "Billboard Table", "normalWidth")
    p I wake up on Sunday and I’m zig zagging again. Two halves of my mind quizzing each other:
    .speech.speech__one "Two months wages. On three fucking billboards. You’re crazy"
    .speech “Don’t use money as an excuse. You know that’s not the reason. Don’t trick yourself”
    .speech “Err, Why don’t I want to do it then?”
    .speech.speech__two “Cause you’re scared. Your afraid of what people might think.”
    p And there we have it. It’s obvious. Money isn’t the reason. I can earn that back. The reason for me not to do it, is because I’m scared. I’m scared of standing out. I’m scared of being a bright colour. And that isn’t a reason. So it’s on.
    p The sun goes down once more and suddenly it's the day of the Billboards. The plan is New York and Wyoming go up at 9pm UK time. And London goes up at 8am the following morning. That way all photos can be done by 9am UK time and I can email out to bloggers and newspapers first thing.
    p There’s still a million things to do. I’ve got no Billboards signed off, no photographers ready, no website made. The last two days have been spent writing hundreds of emails and saving them in drafts, ready to fire out. The next eight hours are a blur. I’m working like an Octopus, organising photographers, organising billboards, teeing up interviews and suddenly everything's coming together. London. New York. Wyoming. All confirmed. And there’s less than an hour to go, and suddenly WACK. 8:11pm an email drops into my inbox and my head spins like I’ve been hit by a steam engine.
    +image("lamar", "Lamar Cancel", "normalWidth")
    p It’s over. Lamar are doing both New York and Wyoming Billboards. If there backing out I’m pulling the whole thing. The games up. It’s over. I’m a normal person again. I’m safe. I’m comfortable. Life’s straightforward. No billboards. No problems.
    p I walk downstairs to show Dad the email. He looks up at me, smiles like it’s nothing and says “Don’t worry. We’ll find a way”. And that’s why you need a team. I was done with the stress of it all and wanted the whole thing over but the old man wasn’t blinking so we fought on.
    p Phone calls start flying everywhere. On one phone I’m talking out options with the account manager. On the other Dad’s posing as a BBC journalist, picking apart their legal departments defence throwing jab after jab, “The kid spent two days clearing this with intellectual property lawyers”, “There’s a camera crew waiting outside Times Square as we speak”.
    p And he keeps hammering and hammering. But nothing we throw is sticking. And I’m just watching him now, unrelenting, relentless, trading his way slowly up the organisation until he’s got the CEO of a multimillion pound corporation on the phone. It’s 9pm now. Some wonderful soul called Candice is waiting in the New York rain eyes glued to the Billboard ready to take the photo, but she isn’t going to wait all day.
    p Suddenly Dad’s beckoning me over. If we change, “Kanye West” for “Mr West” the legal department will approve it. My gut tells me it’s good enough and we’re rocking again. Export the new text, fire to the account manager in Times Square and in the space of 5 minutes the Billboards are live. Candice takes the photo. It appears in my inbox. And I take a deep breath.

    p The Wyoming photo comes through a few hours later and before I know it, it’s 8am UK time.
    +image("bamn3", "Wyoming", "fullWidth", "jpg")
    p The London Billboard goes up, the photos come through and we’re back at the crease attaching the photos to the drafts we prepped, sending our emails around the world, hoping we get lucky again. A couple of stories start breaking, journalists start requesting interviews and back into the Maelstrom we descend. The phone rings and rings and it could be anyone on the line. I’m wished luck, sold life insurance, called a Jackass, thrown onto live radio, taunted by youths, offered jobs, reunited with old school friends.
    +image("bamn2", "London", "fullWidth", "jpg")
    p I check twitter. Kanye's name is trending. My heart jumps. Surely not. Have I made it? I click and my heart sinks. “Kanye West has just said 400 years of slavery sounds like a choice” and from there on in I’m dead in the water. I’m a tadpole in a Shark Tank. The media is at Kanye saturation. The billboards are mince meat. A few more stories trickle through and you know what I can’t complain. All you can do is try. Sometimes you don’t hit a home run.
    p 48 later I think it’s all over. We’ve sent all our emails, we’ve posted everywhere we can. But Dad’s got one final trick up his sleeve. He’s tracked down Yeezy Headquarters on Google Maps. There’s no phone number to call, but there’s some offices nearby which do list their phone numbers. I start dialing and people start answering. I’m telling them about the dating site, and then the Billboards, and most of the time the phone gets put down. But I get through to one girl and we're connecting.
    .speech.speech__one “Funnily enough my friend A***** works at Yeezy”
    .speech “If we send you an email  is there any chance you could forward it on”.
    .speech.speech__two “Leave it with me”
    p And that’s our final act. Now we can go to bed, wake up the next day and get on with our lives.
    p A few weeks pass, and an email from A****** drops into my inbox.
    +image("closer", "Email", "normalWidth")
    p There’s no mad celebration. Just a smile and a little chuckle. After all our efforts. Trying to sweet talk journalists, rehearsing for radio interviews, rewriting press releases, retouching images, our big breakthrough came from a phone call. A simple phone call to the company whose office was next door. And it makes me think about the campaign one more time. There’s loads of flashy stuff you can do which makes you look good. But don’t confuse that flashy stuff for progress. It sounds cool to say, “The story got so big, I was all over the radio, Instagram went wild”. But that stuff is here today gone tomorrow. What gets results is being relentless and beavering on. It’s easy to be motivated when half the world’s watching. We kept going when no one cared anymore. The laughter had stopped, the audience had departed, the lights had gone out. We stuck at it and maybe that’s why we got the call.
