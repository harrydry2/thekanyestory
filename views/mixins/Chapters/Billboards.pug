    p So I’m back in the lab. Emailing away. Managers, ex managers, stylists, pr relations, anyone who has ever worked for YEEZY on Linkedin. But nothing. No replies. I can’t get through.
    p I ask my Dad for advice. “You’ve got to think on a bigger scale son”, he tells me. So now I’m thinking what if I make a video, or a mixtape, or a magazine or a painting, or I rent a plane and fly a banner. Then it hits me. I’m going to rent Billboards. YEEZY is opening offices in Calabasas, New York, London, Wyoming. Four locations. Four billboards. Bart Simpson style.
    p Ten minutes later I’m on the phone with Billboard companies. Quizzing them. What’s your pricing like? What type of Billboard would you recommend? How quickly can we do this? What’s the shortest time each Billboard can stay up for?
    p The answers are good and in my head the billboards are already in the sky.

    p I wake up the next day zig zagging again. Two halves of my mind questioning the other:
    .speech.speech__one "Two months wages. On three fucking billboards. You’re crazy."
    .speech “Don’t use money as an excuse. That’s not the reason.”
    .speech “Err, Why don’t I want to do it then?”
    .speech.speech__two “Cause you’re scared. Your afraid.”
    p And there we have it. It’s obvious. Money isn’t the reason. I can earn that back. The reason for me not to do it, is because I’m scared. I'm sacred of standing out. And that isn’t a good enough reason, so it's on.
    p I draft my Dad onto the campaign team and it’s starting to come together. He’s in his element. We take over my brother's bedroom and set up basecamp. Dad buys three alarm clocks, sets one to New York time, one to LA time and one to Wyoming time. “You’ve got to know your timezone, son,” he tells me.
    p The sun goes down once more and now it's the day of the Billboards. The plan is New York and Wyoming go up at 9pm UK time. And London goes up at 8am the following morning. That way all photos can be done by 9am UK time and I can email out to bloggers and newspapers first thing.
    p There’s still a million things to do. I’ve got no Billboards signed off, no photographers ready, no website made. The last two days have been spent writing hundreds of emails and saving them in drafts, ready to fire out. The next eight hours are a blur. I'm working like an Octopus, organising photographers, organising billboards, teeing up interviews and suddenly everything's coming together. London. New York. Wyoming. All confirmed. There’s less than an hour to go, and suddenly WACK. 8:11pm an email drops into my inbox from Lamar, the Billboard provider, and my head spins like I’ve been hit by Wilder's right hand.

    p It’s over. Lamar were supposed to be doing both the New York and Wyoming Billboards. If they’re backing out I’m pulling the whole thing. The game's up. It’s over. I’m a normal person again. I’m safe. I’m comfortable. Life’s straightforward. No billboards. No problems.
    p I walk downstairs to show Dad the email. He looks up at me, smiles like it’s nothing and says “Don’t worry. We’ll find a way”. And that’s why you need a team. I was done with the stress of it all and wanted the whole thing over but the old man wasn’t blinking so we fought on.
    p Phone calls start flying everywhere. On one phone I’m hammering the account manager. On the other Dad’s posing as a BBC journalist, picking apart their legal departments defence throwing jab after jab, “The kid spent two days clearing this with intellectual property lawyers”, “We’ve got a camera crew waiting outside Times Square as we speak”.
    p And he keeps hammering and hammering. But nothing we throw is sticking. And I’m just watching him now, trading his way slowly up the organisation and now he’s got the CEO of the multi million pound corporation on the phone. It’s 9pm now. A wonderful soul called

      | &nbsp;is waiting in the New York rain eyes glued to the Billboard ready to take the photo, and she isn’t going to wait all day.
    p Suddenly Dad’s beckoning me over. If we change, “Kanye West” for “Mr West” the legal department will approve it. My gut tells me it’s good enough and we’re rocking again. Export the new text, fire to the account manager in Times Square and in the space of 5 minutes the Billboards are live. Candice takes the photo. It appears in my inbox. And I take a deep breath.
    +image("bamn1", "Times Square", "normalWidth bamn1", "jpg")
    p The Wyoming and London Billboard’s go up, and we’re back at it, attaching the photos to the drafts we prepped, sending out our emails, hoping we get lucky again.
    +image("bamn3", "Wyoming", "normalWidth bamn3", "jpg")
    p A couple of stories start breaking, journalists start requesting interviews and back into the Maelstrom we descend. The phone rings and rings and it could be anyone on the line. I’m wished luck, sold insurance, thrown onto live radio, taunted by youths, offered jobs, reunited with old school friends.

    p I check twitter. Kanye's name is trending. My heart jumps. Surely not. Have I made it? I click. My heart sinks. “Kanye West has just said 400 years of slavery sounds like a choice”. And from there on in I’m dead in the water. I’m a tadpole in a shark tank. The media is at Kanye saturation. Journalists have bigger fish to fry. My little story is put on hold.
    p Ok, one last try. I track down Yeezy Headquarters on Google Maps. I find the phone number of some offices nearby and start dialing. I'm telling this receptionist about the dating site, about the Billboards, and I can’t believe it but she’s actually listening to me.
    .speech.speech__one “Funnily enough my best friend A***** works at Yeezy”
    .speech “If I send you an email could you forward it on?”
    .speech.speech__two “Sure”
    p And that's that. Now I can go to bed, wake up the next day and get on with my life.
    p.weeksLater *&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*
    p A few weeks pass and, lo and behold, an email from A****** drops into my inbox.
    +image("closer", "Email", "normalWidth closerIMG")
    p And a few hours later someone sends me a screenshot from Kanye's office chat.
    +image("iMessage2", "iMessage", "normalWidth specImg60")
    p After all my efforts emailing journalists, practicing for radio interviews, writing press releases, retouching images, all it took was a simple phone call to the company whose office was next door.
