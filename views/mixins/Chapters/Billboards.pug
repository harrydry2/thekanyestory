    p So I’m back in the lab. Emailing and Emailing. Managers, ex managers, stylists, pr relations, anyone who has ever worked for YEEZY on Linkedin. But nothing. No replies. No leads. I can’t get through.
    p I ask my Dad for advice. “You’ve got to think on a bigger scale son”, he tells me.
    p So I’m back in the lab the next day and for eight hours solid I’m just streaming ideas. What if I make a video, or a mixtape, or a magazine or a painting, or I rent a plane and fly a banner. Then it hits me. I’m going to rent Billboards. YEEZY is opening offices in Calabasas, New York, London, Wyoming. Four locations. Four billboards. Nothing fancy. No frills. Just brute force. Simple. Controversial. Crazy.
    p Ten minutes later I’m on the phone with Billboard companies. Quizzing them. Trying to understand the landscape. What’s your pricing like? What type of Billboard would you recommend? How quickly can we do this? What’s the shortest time each Billboard can stay up for? The numbers aren’t too expensive and in my head it’s already happened. I’ve committed to it and there’s no turning back.

    p I draft my Dad onto the campaign team and it’s starting to come together. Dad’s in his element. He’s a media manipulator pro. I’m talking one of the greatest of all time. We take over my younger brothers bedroom and set up basecamp. Dad buys three alarm clocks, sets one to New York time, one to LA time and one to Wyoming time. “You’ve got to know your timezone, son” he tells me.
    p One minute we’re dashing off to buy a phone which can call the US, next we’re back at basecamp, plotting like Churchill and Delano Roosevelt, growing the media list, drafting our emails, scheming.
    p I wake up on Sunday and a couple of friends are texting me asking if I want to play tennis and have a few beers. Suddenly I’m nervous. I’d be running on autopilot up to now. Laser focus on the job. Suddenly I’ve been brought right back down to Earth. I’m sitting in mission control and real world shit is going on around me and maybe I’m too wrapped up in my own reality. And for the first time I’m doubting myself. Two months wages. On three fucking billboards.
    p I cycle to the park and call my friend Sheehan. “You’re on Level 1. And if you pull out you’ll still be on Level 1” he tells me. Then I call my brother Tom.
    .speech.speech__one “Why are you doing this?”
    .speech "Maybe Kanye sees the Billboards and backs the site"
    .speech “What’s the chance of that happening?”
    .speech "20%”
    .speech "How much is an endorsement from Kanye worth?”
    .speech "I know Kylie Jenner is paid £1m for every Instagram post, but that seems ridiculous so maybe £230k”
    .speech “And how much are you spending?”
    .speech “1000 for London, 500 for Wyoming, 800 for New York so £2.3k.”
    .speech.speech__two "Look at it like a bet. You’re stake is 2.3k to and your return is 230k. So the odds should be 100 / 1 but you’re saying your odds are 10 / 1. Don’t look at it as something big and scary. Just look at it like a bet, and if you make enough of these sorts of bets enough times you’ll be a millionaire pretty soon.”
    p And there we have it. It’s blindly obvious. The only reason to not do it, is because I’m afraid. The only reason to not do it is because Im afraid of breaking the simulation. And that isn’t a good enough reason. So I’ve got to roll the dice.
    p The sun goes down once more and suddenly it's the day of the Billboards. The plan is New York and Wyoming go up at 9pm UK time. And London goes up at 8am the following morning. That way we can have all the photos sorted by 9am UK time and we can start pumping out to the media first thing.
    p There’s still a million things to do. I’ve got no Billboards signed off, no photographers ready, no website ready. The last two days has been spent writing hundreds of emails and saving them in drafts, ready to fire out.

    p The next eight hours are a blur. I’m talking to my mum and she’s concerned and ego’s are clashing Dad’s resigned and it’s all unravelling, and 30 minutes later he’s back working the phone like only he can, and next we’re sitting out in mission control strategising, and I’m working like an Octopus, tentacles everywhere organising photographers, organising billboards and suddenly everything's coming together. London. New York. Wyoming. All confirmed, and there’s less than an hour to go, and suddenly WACK. 8:11pm an email drops into my inbox and my head spins like I’ve been dealt an uppercut.
    +image("lamar", "Lamar Cancel", "normalWidth")
    p It’s over. Lamar are doing both New York and Wyoming Billboards. If there backing out I’m pulling the whole project. The games up. It’s over. I’m a normal person again. I’m safe. I’m comfortable. Life’s straightforward. No billboards. No problems.
    p I walk downstairs to show Dad the email. And in that moment you recognise the difference between an amateur and a pro, between a rookie and a master. He looks up at me, smiles like it’s nothing and says “Don’t worry. We’ll find a way”. And that’s why you need a team cause I was done with the stress of it all and wanted the whole thing over but the old man wasn’t blinking so we fought on.
    p If the last eight hours were a blur, the next 45 minutes are a whirlwind. Phone calls are flying everywhere. On one phone I’m hammering the account manager. On the other Dad’s posing as a BBC journalist, picking apart their legal departments defence throwing jab after jab, “The kid spent two days clearing this with intellectual property lawyers”, “There’s a camera crew waiting outside Times Square as we speak”.
    p And he keeps hammering and hammering. But nothing we throw is sticking. And I’m just watching now, watching a master at work, serene as Federer on centre, single minded is his approach, beating the drum, unrelenting, relentless, trading his way slowly the organisation and now he’s got the CEO of a multimillion pound corporation on the phone. It’s 9pm now. Some wonderful soul called Candice is waiting in the New York rain eyes glued to the Billboard ready to take the photo, and she isn’t going to wait all day.
    p Suddenly Dad’s beckoning me over. If we change, “Kanye West” for “Mr West” the legal department will approve it. My gut tells me it’s good enough and we’re rocking again. I mock up some new artwork on Photoshop, export as PDF, fire to my guys on the ground in Times Square and Wyoming and in the space of 5 minutes the Billboards are live. 45 minutes of chaos and finally Candice’s photo drops in my inbox. I take a deep breathe. Dad knew this was only outcome all along.
    +image("bamn1", "Times Square", "fullWidth", "jpg")
    p The Wyoming photo comes through a few hours later and before I know it, it’s 8am UK time.
    +image("bamn3", "Wyoming", "fullWidth", "jpg")
    p The London Billboard goes up, the photos come through and now we’re in album mode attaching photos to the drafts we prepped, firing every cannon in our artillery. A couple of stories start breaking, journalists start requesting interviews and back into the Maelstrom we descend. The phone rings and rings and it could be anyone on the line. I’m wished luck, sold life insurance, called a Jackass, thrown onto live radio, laughed at, offered jobs, reunited with old school friends.
    +image("bamn2", "London", "fullWidth", "jpg")
    p I check twitter. Kanye's name is trending. My heart skips a beat. Surely not. Have I made it? I click and my heart sinks. “Kanye West has just said 400 years of slavery sounds like a choice” and from there on in I’m dead in the water. I’m a tadpole in a Shark Tank. The media is at Kanye saturation. My story is mince meat.
    p But we didn’t come all this way to just down tools so keep beating the drum as best we can. Some more stories trickle through and you know what I can’t complain. Sometime you don’t hit a home run. We’ve thrown the kitchen sink and that’s all we can do.
    p 48 later I think it’s all over. We’ve sent all our emails, we’ve posted everywhere we can, but Dad’s got one final trick up his sleeve. He’s tracked down Yeezy Headquarters on Google Maps. There’s no phone number to call, but there’s some offices nearby which do list their phone numbers. And I start dialing and people start answering. I’m telling them about the dating site, and then the Billboards, and most of the time the phone gets put down. But I get through to one girl who’s drinking up every word and we're connecting.
    .speech.speech__one “Funnily enough my friend A***** works at Yeezy”
    .speech “If we send you an email  is there any chance you could forward it on”.
    .speech.speech__two “Leave it with me”
    p And that’s our final act. After that we can do no more. We can go to bed, wake up the next day and get on with our lives. It’s nice being normal again. I can take my time over with my Weebabix now.
    p A few weeks pass, and an email from A****** drops into my inbox.
    +image("closer", "Email", "fullWidth")
    p There’s no mad celebration. Just a smile and a little chuckle. After all our efforts. Trying to sweet talk journalists, rehearsing for radio interviews, rewriting press releases, retouching images, our big breakthrough came from a phone call. A simple phone call to the company whose office was next door. And it makes me think about the campaign one more time. There’s loads of flashy shit you can do which makes you look good. But don’t confuse that flashy shit for progress. It sounds cool to say, “The story got so big, I was all over the radio, Instagram went wild” but that stuff is here today gone tomorrow. What get results is keeping it simple, going direct, bulldozing you way through.
