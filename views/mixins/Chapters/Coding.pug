    p I wake up and head straight to the lab. It’s time to build a dating site. First things first I scout other dating sites just looking for something I can rip off. The whole Tinder / Bumble swiping thing is a non starter. It’s too complex. I find a Jewish Dating site called J Date which looks promising. They are displaying all user profiles on one long infinite scroll page. A few months earlier I did Wes Bos’ “Learn Node” course where he does a similar thing with restaurants. I start merging J Date with some lessons from Wes’ course and I'm up and running.

    p At this point there isn’t much too tell you. There’s no secret ingredient. No magic pill. Just long days in the lab laying bricks. It's like I'm doing my dissertation all over again. Except this time I actually care.

    p 10 months ago I hadn’t wrote a line of code before and I thought it was too hard. One week into Yeezy Dating it’s still too hard. Webpack is fucking me and I don’t know how to save geoJSON data. Boo-hoo. Nobody cares. I don’t care. Find a way. Figure it out. Everyone else figured it out.

    p When I get stuck, I figure it out. I'm coding like the end is near. I'm so fucking clueless. Problem after Problem. Forum after forum. I'm the most hatest man on Stack Overflow. And I'm not going anywhere. I'm United in 99". Corner after corner after corner. Keep believing. Find a way.
